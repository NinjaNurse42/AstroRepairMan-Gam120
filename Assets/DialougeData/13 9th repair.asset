  - "Damage Control: Engines are as in good shape as they\u2019ll be. One last repair
    to the coolant line and we\u2019re set."
  - 'Captain: How much time do we have left?'
  - 'Damage Control: Five minutes at the most.'
  - "Captain: What\u2019s your name?\r\n"
  - "Damage Control: Ma\u2019am, we\u2019ll make it."
  - "Captain: I\u2019m Selina.\r\n"
  - 'Damage Control: Heh, high class.'
  - 'Selina: Sure am. Always loved the stars.

'
  - 'Damage Control: I was more of a planet gal myself. Grew up on Mars. '
  - 'Damage Control: Not much to see there. I signed up for the navy first chance
    I got to get away from home.'
  - 'Selina: Not a great place?'
  - "Damage Control: \u2026"
  - "Damage Control: You have no idea. Don\u2019t have this scar on my face for decoration."
  - "Selina: I\u2019m\u2026 sorry."
  - "Damage Control: Don\u2019t worry about it. If anything it taught me to treat
    my kids better. Name\u2019s Mindy, by the way."
  - "Selina: It\u2019s been an honor serving with you, Mindy.\r\n"
  - 'Mindy: You too, Captain.'
