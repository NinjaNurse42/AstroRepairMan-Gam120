  - "Damage Control: Captain, we\u2019re falling into an asteroid field."
  - "Captain: What\u2019s the damage gonna look like?"
  - "Damage Control: Nothing major, but it\u2019ll be a rough ride. How\u2019s the
    crew?"
  - "Captain: Scientists are under control, but nobody likes sitting around waiting
    to see if we\u2019re gonna die."
  - "Damage Control: What if we clone him multiple times? It\u2019ll make the job
    faster."
  - 'Captain: Absolutely not.'
  - "Damage Control: We\u2019d save lives."
  - "Captain: And we\u2019d have to kill any that live afterwards, unless we want
    everyone on board to die too."
  - 'Damage Control: The Seattle Incident was one mishap. How many other times did
    clones meet and not kill each other?'
  - "Captain: That\u2019s the only time on record."
  - 'Damage Control: On record. If the crew want solace, we can give it to them faster.'
  - "Captain: You\u2019re out of line. This matter is closed."
