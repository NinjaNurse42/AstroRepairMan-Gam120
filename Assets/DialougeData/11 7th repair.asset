  - "Captain: Crew\u2019s eased up a bit, but the growing pit of darkness out the
    viewport isn\u2019t helping.\r\n"
  - "Damage Control: Captain, we\u2019re gonna be cutting it close.\r\n"
  - 'Captain: How close?'
  - "Damage Control: With our current progress rate, we\u2019ll leave with five minutes
    to spare. We\u2019re running out of scrap nearby."
  - 'Damage Control: Might have to start diving out past the station, into the oncoming
    asteroids. That takes time.'
  - "Captain: I\u2026 "
  - "Damage Control: It\u2019s not game over yet."
  - 'Captain: Get those clones online.

'
  - "Damage Control: Ma\u2019am?"
  - 'Captain: We have a responsibility to these people. I am going to get them back
    to their families.'
  - "Damage Control: Copy that\u2026 No\u2026 No, no no."
  - "Captain: What\u2019s happening?\r\n"
  - 'Damage Control: Power to the cloning facility has been cut off.'
  - 'Captain: They have emergency batteries, though.

'
  - "Damage Control: Yeah, but that won\u2019t last forever, and if all the clones
    die at once\u2026"
  - "Captain: I see. Well, that settles it. I\u2019ll angle the escape pods to give
    them as long of an orbit around the black hole as possible."
  - "Captain: If anyone reads our distress signal, maybe they\u2019ll be able to
    get here in time to save them."
  - 'Damage Control: Evacuate the people you can, but keep transports on standby.
    If we can fix this coolant leak, we can leave and pick them up.'
  - "Damage Control: Captain\u2019s getting desperate. Once the Newton\u2019s in
    the black hole, our distress signal stops."
  - "Damage Control: No one\u2019s gonna pay attention to a blip on their feed this
    far out. It\u2019s all up to you.\r\n"
