  - 'Damage Control: How you holding up Captain?'
  - "Captain: I\u2019m\u2026 scared."
  - "Captain: I have faith that he\u2019ll get it done. I just don\u2019t know how
    much larger this bubble of unrest will get before it pops."
  - "Damage Control: I\u2019ve dealt with something like this before, y\u2019know."
  - 'Captain: Really?'
  - 'Damage Control: It was the cruise ship Zenith. During a twenty-week nebula tour,
    she had a fuel leak next to a neutron star.'
  - 'Damage Control: We had maybe an hour or two before the fuel would seep out into
    the ignited engines and the entire ship would go up in flames.'
  - 'Damage Control: You think professional scientists lose their cool? Try a cruise
    ship of rich tourists with everything to lose.'
  - "Damage Control: My team and I were under constant pressure from them and our
    superiors, and dying in my early twenties wasn\u2019t something on my bucket
    list."
  - "Damage Control: We got it sorted out. We\u2019ll be alright."
  - "Captain: I\u2019ll speak to them again. Good luck."
