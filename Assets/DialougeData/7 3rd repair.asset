  - 'Captain: Progress?'
  - 'Damage Control: About a third of the way done. Something wrong?'
  - 'Captain: The scientists are in full panic. '
  - "Captain: I\u2019m trying to maintain order, and security is trying to keep them
    from \u201Crescuing\u201D their projects, which will look more like disassembling
    and carrying out all their equipment to the escape pods."

  - "Damage Control: If we do our jobs in the present, we won\u2019t have to worry
    about that. I believe in you, Captain."
  - 'Captain: Thanks.'
